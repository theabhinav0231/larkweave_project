**Empowering Wisdom. Connecting Generations. Powered by AI.**

Larkweave is a dynamic platform designed to bridge the generational gap through skill-sharing and mentorship. It allows experienced mentors to share real-world skills, knowledge, and creativity with younger learners through AI-enhanced content, community collaboration, and progress tracking.

Built during a 48-hour hackathon, Larkweave is more than just a project—it's a movement toward sustainable, cross-generational learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Larkweave connects mentors and learners through a seamless, AI-driven learning experience:

- Mentors upload short videos of skills or project demos.
- The system transcribes, summarizes, and generates structured learning content using **OpenAI Whisper** and **Google Gemma-3-27B-IT**.
- Learners engage with the material, upload progress, and receive real-time feedback.
- Final projects are showcased in a **Marketplace Gallery**, promoting visibility and appreciation.
- A community forum built with **Streamlit** fosters ongoing dialogue and peer learning.

> 🧠 “We believe knowledge is not just for passing down—but weaving across generations.”
